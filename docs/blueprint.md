# **App Name**: Eternal Echoes

## Core Features:

- Story Steps: Wizard-style navigation through 8 key moments of the relationship, displayed full screen, one step at a time, on mobile or desktop.
- Dynamic Photo Collage: Display 3-6 images per step, scattered randomly around the text. Positions and rotations update on each visit, mimicking photos on a table.
- Interactive Question: Presents a central question on the final step, with 'Yes' and evasive 'No' buttons. No uses on-click/on-hover evasion. Yes grows incrementally on each use of the No tool and its text reflects ever increasing enthusiasm.
- Celebratory Confirmation: A confirmation screen appears after the 'Yes' button is clicked, displaying a celebratory message.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft rose (#E980FC) to convey a sense of romance and intimacy.
- Background color: Very light pink (#F8E7F9) to provide a gentle, dreamy backdrop.
- Accent color: Lavender (#B388FF) to add a touch of magic and whimsy, especially for interactive elements.
- Font for all text: 'Alegreya', a serif font for a classic and storytelling feel. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Full-screen layout with vertically and horizontally centered text on each step, designed specifically for mobile responsiveness.
- Smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions between story steps and views.
- Layered background with a static texture of romantic doodles and a dynamic animation of slowly floating flowers from bottom to top.
